server is wamp
http://localhost/             (made a new index.html  and place in www folder so that directly accessible to localhost)
http://localhost/index1.php   ( To secure server changed original index.php to index1.php)
http://localhost/phpmyadmin/index.php (server login page inside phpmyadmin)
http://localhost/Pheonix/      (index.html page of Pheonix)
http://localhost/Pheonix/page.html  (registraion page)
http://localhost/Pheonix/page2.html  (rregisteration completion)
http://localhost/Pheonix/page3.html and http://localhost/Pheonix/page4.html  (error page)

while seeting wamp up let things be defalut username root password=""
while making insert.php we give dbname table name username and password
here db name = mydb and table name is register
 make sure all files remain in place from where they are accessible.



so basically download wamp for windows 10 and latest version of visual studio c++ redistribution
install run wamp so icon become green
while setting things up make things defalut
in local server log in as root
make a db by pressing "new" give name mydb make table with name reister and property as in screen shot
place every file in place
youll be able to locally host your website at above link to make website publicly available see tunneling 

//tunneling
place lt-win in desktop 
do as in screenshot but since now pankaj567 is already taken use something else.
youll get a url share it and use it
